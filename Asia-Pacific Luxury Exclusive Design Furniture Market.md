The residential segment has emerged as a key area of growth within the luxury furniture market. As consumer preferences shift towards higher-end, bespoke, and personalized home furnishings, luxury furniture brands have experienced a surge in demand. Consumers in the residential sector are increasingly looking for unique and stylish furniture that reflects their lifestyle and individual taste, thereby creating a market for exclusive design pieces. The design of such furniture plays a critical role in the homeowner's desire to create a comfortable, yet luxurious living space. This demand is particularly evident in high-net-worth households, with affluent individuals keen to invest in furniture that offers exclusivity, craftsmanship, and a sense of prestige.In addition, the residential luxury furniture market is also supported by the growing trend of high-end interior design services.
